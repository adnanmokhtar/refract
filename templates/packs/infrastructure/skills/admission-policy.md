# Skill: admission-policy

## Premise

Signing an image (devops `release-security`) means nothing until the cluster **refuses to run anything unsigned or CVE-failing**. Admission control is the enforcement point — a policy that runs at `kubectl apply` time and *rejects* a workload that violates it. The pack sets secure defaults *when it generates* a manifest (`k8s-generate`), but nothing stops a hand-written or third-party manifest that skips them. This skill generates the admission policy that makes the security posture non-bypassable — closing the "admission control is mentioned but never generated" gap and giving `release-security`'s `cosign sign` a verifier.

**Every generated policy cites what it enforces + the failure message a rejected workload gets.** Generate policy that fails closed; a policy in `Audit`/`warn` mode that never blocks is theater — default to `Enforce`.

## Adapt to the codebase

Detect the admission engine in use (or recommend one) and generate for it:

| Engine | Best for | Image-signature verification |
|---|---|---|
| **Kyverno** | most teams — YAML policies, good UX | `verifyImages` rule with `keyless` (cosign OIDC) |
| **Sigstore policy-controller** | signature-first shops | `ClusterImagePolicy` (native cosign/Fulcio/Rekor) |
| **OPA Gatekeeper** | Rego-standardized orgs | constraint templates (+ `ratify`/`cosign` for signatures) |
| **Native ValidatingAdmissionPolicy** | K8s ≥1.30, no extra controller | CEL expressions (pod-security; signatures still need a controller) |

Mirror the cluster's existing engine; only introduce one if none exists (recommend Kyverno).

## Generates

### 1. Image-signature verification (the release-security counterpart)

Only images signed by the CI's OIDC identity admit — keyless, no key to distribute:

```yaml
# Kyverno
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata: { name: verify-image-signatures }
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce            # fail closed
  rules:
    - name: check-cosign-signature
      match: { any: [{ resources: { kinds: [Pod] } }] }
      verifyImages:
        - imageReferences: ["<registry>/*"]
          attestors:
            - entries:
                - keyless:
                    issuer: "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"   # your CI OIDC issuer
                    subject: "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/.github/workflows/*"
```
Optionally also require the SBOM / SLSA-provenance attestation (`attestations:`) that `release-security` produced.

### 2. Pod Security Standards (restricted) — enforced, not just defaulted

Reject `privileged`, `hostNetwork`/`hostPID`/`hostIPC`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true`, missing `runAsNonRoot`, un-dropped capabilities, writable root FS, and no `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`. Prefer the built-in **Pod Security Admission** label (`pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted`) on the namespace + a Kyverno/VAP backstop for the specifics.

### 3. Supply-chain + provenance gate

Reject images by mutable tag (`:latest` / no digest); require the digest form so the signature binds. Optionally require the CVE-scan attestation to be present and passing.

### 4. Egress / network default-deny reference

Point at `k8s-generate`'s default-deny `NetworkPolicy` (blocks pod→metadata `169.254.169.254`) — the runtime belt to the code-level SSRF suspenders (`security/skills/ssrf-scan.md`).

## Output

```
admission-policy — <cluster/namespace>   (engine: Kyverno)

Generated:
  policies/verify-image-signatures.yaml   Enforce — keyless cosign, issuer=<ci>, subject=<repo>
  policies/pod-security-restricted.yaml    Enforce — non-root, no-priv, drop-caps, RO-rootfs, seccomp
  policies/require-digest.yaml             Enforce — reject mutable :tag, require @sha256

Verify:  kubectl apply --dry-run=server of an unsigned image → REJECTED with the policy message.
```

## False positives / gotchas

- **Roll out in `Audit` first, then flip to `Enforce`** — an Enforce policy on an existing cluster can block system workloads (kube-system, the ingress controller). Scope exclusions explicitly, then enforce.
- **Keyless subject/issuer must match your CI exactly** — a wrong `subject` regex fails every deploy (or, worse, an over-broad one verifies nothing). Pin to your repo's workflow identity.
- **Signature verify needs registry reachability + Rekor** — air-gapped clusters need a mirrored transparency log.
- **Pod Security Admission ≠ signature verification** — PSA covers the securityContext; images still need Kyverno/policy-controller. Use both.

## When to run

- When standing up a cluster's security baseline, or after devops `release-security` starts signing (so the signatures get verified).
- Alongside `k8s-generate` (which sets the defaults) + `k8s-audit` (which reports drift) — this is the *enforcement* layer between them.

## Halt conditions

- Halt on a generated policy left in `Audit`/`warn` when the intent is enforcement — say so explicitly and require the operator to opt into Audit.
- Do not generate a signature policy with a placeholder/over-broad `subject` — it must bind to the project's real CI identity or it verifies nothing.
- Do not claim "images verified" without a policy that actually rejects an unsigned image (dry-run proof in the output).

- `k8s-generate` — sets secure defaults on generated manifests; `k8s-audit` — reports posture drift; this **enforces** at admission so nothing bypasses.
