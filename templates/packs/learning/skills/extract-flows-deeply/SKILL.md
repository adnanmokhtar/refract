description: Round-two deep extraction of business-critical and admin/internal flows — traces ≥5 representative flows end-to-end (trigger → entry → ordered steps → side effects → error paths → idempotency). Used by /setup-project Phase 2.9 in REFINE mode to upgrade round-one flow detection from "the app does checkout" to a precise step-by-step narration with file:line for every step.

# Skill: extract-flows-deeply

## Purpose

A flow is a *user-meaningful* sequence (signup, checkout, refund, file upload, nightly batch). Round-one Phase 2 doesn't enumerate flows — it detects entry-point shapes (HTTP routes, queue listeners). Round-two follows individual flows from trigger to final side effect.

The output is what enables an agent working on a related task to say "I see — to add a discount to checkout, I need to insert a step between `cart.validated` and `payment.charged`, and the discount must be reflected in the receipt event published at the end."

## Premise

- Real source is the truth. Walk each flow's call graph end-to-end — entry handler, every middleware in the chain, every called function down to DB / external / queue / cache boundaries — before recording a step.
- Every step cites `<file:function:line>` resolved at the current commit; every side effect is read from the actual method body, not inferred from class names.
- Error paths are walked the same way as happy paths — they reveal where recovery / retry / silent-fail lives.
- Empty extraction is honest — a flow with `idempotency: none` is a finding (not a gap); a `[REFINE-WEAK: flows-coverage]` flag is a valid output when <5 flows trace.
- Fabrication — inferring an external-vendor call from a class name (e.g., guessing payment-provider use from an `EmailService`), asserting a transaction boundary that isn't in code, mixing two flows that share a middle — produces a runbook the team will trust and follow incorrectly.

## Mechanical halt

- Hand-wave in flow output — `etc.`, `...`, `the usual middleware`, `appears to be transactional`, a `steps:` entry without `<file:function:line>`, an `error_paths:` entry without `raised_at:` + `caught_at:`, a flow whose call graph wasn't actually walked — REFUSE to write the YAML.
- Re-trace and regenerate the flow OR downgrade it to `[REFINE-WEAK: flows-coverage]`.
- If <5 flows are traceable, write `<NOT-DETECTED: flows: <N> below threshold 5: <reason>>` per the WEAK gate.
- Never average across surfaces — HTTP, queue, and scheduled handlers behave differently and each gets its own traced row.

## When to use

- `/setup-project --refine` Phase 2.9 — extract ≥3 business-critical flows + ≥2 admin/internal flows.

## Where the output lands

- **Default destination: `ai/business-flows.md`.** The traces written to `_refine-extract.md` § Flows are enriched into the round-one flow catalog by Phase 4.7-DEEP — each matching flow's `Happy path` / `Invariants` / `Failure modes` gains `file:function:line` steps, per-step side effects, error paths, idempotency, and transaction boundary; a traced flow with no round-one match is appended as a new catalog entry. This is the load-bearing file feature-work agents read (Tier 2: "New feature → `ai/business-flows.md`").
- **Secondary, opt-in: `ai/runbooks/<flow>.md`** — only when explicitly requested via `--refine --include-runbooks`. Runbooks are the operational long-form; `ai/business-flows.md` is the always-on default and is never gated behind the flag.

## Inputs

- `flow_count` (default: 5; min 5 for STRONG).
- `flow_hints` (optional) — user-provided list of flow names. If present, prioritize these over auto-discovery.
- `output_section` — section path (default: `## Flows`).

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Pick flows to trace

Auto-discover sources for flow candidates (combine and dedupe):

1. **Lifecycle events from Phase 2.7** — every event that has ≥2 emitters or is consumed by ≥1 handler is a flow.
2. **README.md / CONTRIBUTING.md / docs/** — search for headings matching `## How <X> works`, `## <Verb>ing <noun>`, `## End-to-end`, `### Flow`, `## Lifecycle`.
3. **Test file names** — the project's e2e / integration test naming convention (e.g., `*_e2e.<test-ext>`, `*_integration_test.<test-ext>`, `test_<flow>_flow.<test-ext>`, `<Flow>IntegrationTest.<ext>`). The flow name is often in the filename.
4. **Observability / monitoring config** — if accessible, transactions named `<verb>.<noun>` in the project's APM tool are critical user paths.
5. **High-coverage endpoints / consumers** — heuristic: top 10 by coverage % or git churn.

Pick:

- 3+ business-critical (user-facing) flows.
- 2+ admin/internal flows (`bulk-import`, `nightly-rebuild-stats`, `daily-reconciliation`, `cleanup-stale-sessions`).

If the codebase is too small for 5 distinct flows, lower the count and flag `[REFINE-WEAK: flows-coverage]` in the output.

### Step 2 — Trace each flow

For each picked flow:

1. **Trigger**: HTTP request? scheduled job (cron)? queue message? user action? webhook?
2. **Entry point**: file:line of the handler function.
3. **Ordered steps**: walk the call graph (re-use the procedure from `extract-architecture-deeply` Step 4). Record each step as one line: `<file:function:line> — <1-sentence what it does>`.
4. **Side effects** at each step:
   - DB writes (entity, operation: insert/update/delete, transactional?).
   - External calls (vendor, endpoint, sync/async).
   - Queue publishes (topic, payload-shape one-liner).
   - Cache writes/invalidations.
   - File writes (where, format).
   - Email / SMS / webhook / notification sends.
5. **Error paths**: at each step, what exceptions are raised + where they're caught + what response/state results.
6. **Idempotency mechanism**:
   - Idempotency key from request header? client-generated UUID? deterministic hash of payload?
   - DB unique constraint guarding double-write?
   - Outbox-pattern + at-least-once consumer?
   - **Or no idempotency mechanism** — if so, record `idempotency: NONE` (this is itself an important finding for round-two perf/reliability artifacts).
7. **Concurrency mode**: are steps sequential? batched? parallel? Cross-reference with Phase 2 Step 15 concurrency-primitive detection.
8. **Total side-effect surface**: sum at the end — "1 invoice row, N ledger rows, 1 outbox event, 1 payment-provider charge call, 0 emails."

### Step 3 — Output

Write to `.claude/_refine-extract.md` under `## Flows`:

```yaml
extraction_date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
flow_count: <N>
strong_signals: ["business-flows", "admin-flows", "idempotency", "side-effects"]

flows:
  - name: <verb-noun e.g. checkout, signup, refund>
    classification: <business-critical|admin-internal>
    trigger: <HTTP POST /api/checkout | cron `0 2 * * *` | queue `orders.created`>
    entry_point: <file:line>
    middleware_chain: [<list of file:line>]
    steps:
      - file: <file:function:line>
        does: <1-sentence>
        side_effects: [<list>]
      # ... ordered
    error_paths:
      - condition: <e.g. payment-declined>
        raised_at: <file:line>
        caught_at: <file:line>
        response: <e.g. 402 + customer email>
    idempotency: <key-mechanism|unique-constraint|outbox|none>
    transaction_boundary: <file:line of the project's transaction primitive (e.g., `BEGIN ... COMMIT`, `transaction { ... }`, framework-equivalent), or "no explicit boundary">
    total_side_effects:
      db_writes: { Invoice: 1, LedgerEntry: 5 }
      external_calls: [<list>]
      queue_publishes: [<list>]
      emails_sent: <N>
    concurrency: <sequential|batched|parallel|mixed>
    notes: |
      <2-3 lines on what's surprising / notable about this flow,
       e.g. "Payment-provider call is BEFORE DB write — payment success without DB persist
       requires manual reconciliation. See ADR-0034.">
  # repeat per flow
```

## Quality gate

- **STRONG**: ≥ 5 flows total, each with all fields populated, ≥ 3 business-critical.
- **WEAK**: < 5 flows OR several flows have empty `steps` (couldn't trace through call graph).

## Anti-patterns

- **Tracing only the happy path** — error paths often reveal more about the architecture (where is recovery? does the system retry? does it fail loudly or silently?).
- **Stopping at the controller** — controllers usually delegate; the flow is in the service + repository.
- **Mixing two flows** — if `POST /api/checkout` calls `BillingService.create_invoice` AND `BillingService.create_invoice` is ALSO called from `POST /api/recurring-charge/run`, those are TWO flows that share a middle. Trace each independently.
- **Inferring side effects from class name** — read the actual method body. A class called `EmailService` may also write to the database.
- **Calling absence-of-idempotency a bug** — sometimes it's intentional. Record the absence; let the user decide whether it's a finding or a feature.
