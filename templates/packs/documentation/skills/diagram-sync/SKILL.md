# diagram-sync

## Premise

An architecture diagram is a *rendering of the real module/import graph*, re-verified against that graph — never hand-drawn in a whiteboard tool, pasted in, and left to rot. A diagram that contradicts the code is worse than none: it teaches a wrong mental model with the authority of a picture, and readers trust it precisely because it looks deliberate.

Cite-or-halt. Every node and edge in a generated diagram traces to a `<path>` (a module directory) or a `<path:line>` (the import / service call that creates the edge). Every DRIFT finding cites **the diagram element + the graph fact that contradicts it** — "box `PaymentGateway` in docs/architecture.md, no module resolves to it (deleted in `git log --diff-filter=D`)". "The diagram looks stale" is a vibe, not a finding.

**Boundary — this skill does NOT build the dependency graph.** The module/import graph is produced by `code-quality`'s `architectural-diagnosis` skill and emitted to `ai/optimize/_dep-graph.json` (rows: `{from, to, layer_from, layer_to}`) plus `ai/optimize/_responsibility-map.md`. diagram-sync **consumes** that artifact and renders it. If the artifact is absent, halt and ask for an architectural-diagnosis run first — do not re-walk the source and reinvent a parallel, drifting graph. Rendering is this skill; graphing is that one.

## When to run

- After a refactor that adds, removes, renames, or re-wires a module or service.
- Before a release / design review — the diagram is the first thing a reviewer reads.
- Weekly in CI to catch slow drift between the committed diagram and the graph.
- When onboarding — a new engineer reads the picture before the code; a wrong picture costs days.
- **Not** for statement-level or per-function structure — this is module/service/container altitude only.

## Procedure

1. **Load the graph — do not rebuild it.** Read `ai/optimize/_dep-graph.json` + `ai/optimize/_responsibility-map.md` from a current `architectural-diagnosis` run. Pin the commit it was generated at; if the graph's commit is behind `HEAD`, note it and re-request the graph rather than patching around staleness.
2. **Pick the C4 level(s) the audience needs.** Context (systems + external actors, no internals), Container (deployable/runnable units — services, DBs, queues, SPAs), Component (modules inside one container). One diagram = one level; mixing levels is itself a defect (see detectors).
3. **Project the graph to that level.** Collapse the module graph into the chosen altitude: for Container, group modules by deployable unit; for Component, keep module nodes within one container and their intra-container edges. Label edges with the relationship the code shows (import, HTTP call, event publish, DB read).
4. **Render as mermaid or C4.** Emit a fenced ` ```mermaid ` block (`graph`/`flowchart`, or `C4Context`/`C4Container`/`C4Component` if the toolchain supports the C4 mermaid dialect). Every node carries its source `<path>`; every edge annotates its `<path:line>` origin in a trailing comment or legend.
5. **Embed in docs.** Write/replace the diagram inside the canonical doc (`ai/architecture.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, or the `## High-level architecture` section a `system-design` doc calls for) between stable marker comments so re-runs replace in place rather than appending duplicates.
6. **DRIFT check (the core verb).** Diff the *committed* diagram against the *current* graph, both directions:
   - **element-in-diagram-not-in-graph** → a box/edge for a module or call that no longer exists (deleted / renamed). Flag `DIAGRAM-DRIFT (stale node)`.
   - **element-in-graph-not-in-diagram** → a module or service edge the graph has that the picture omits. Flag `DIAGRAM-DRIFT (missing node)`.
   - **wrong-level** → the committed diagram claims to be Context but contains internal modules (Component detail), or vice-versa. Flag `LEVEL-MISMATCH`.
7. **Halt or emit.** On drift, regenerate the diagram from the graph and show the diff; never silently overwrite without surfacing what changed.

## Adapt to the codebase

Detect the diagram target and renderer the repo already uses; mirror it rather than imposing one.

| Signal | Render target |
|---|---|
| Markdown docs with existing ` ```mermaid ` fences | mermaid `flowchart` / `graph` — cheapest, GitHub renders it inline |
| `C4Context` / `C4Container` blocks already present, or a `structurizr` DSL | C4 (mermaid C4 dialect or Structurizr) — keep the same tool |
| PlantUML (`.puml`) files in the tree | PlantUML `!include <C4/...>` — match the existing convention |
| Graphviz `.dot` in build scripts | keep `.dot`; mermaid only if migrating |

Altitude follows the graph's shape: a single-service repo needs Context + Container; a monorepo of services needs Context + Container + one Component diagram per non-trivial service. Group nodes using the module boundaries already in `_responsibility-map.md` — don't invent groupings the codebase doesn't hold.

## Output

Literal report: the regenerated diagram, then the drift table against the committed one.

```
diagram-sync — ai/architecture.md § High-level architecture (Container level)
Graph source: ai/optimize/_dep-graph.json @ commit 4f2a9c1  ·  11 modules, 18 edges

Drift vs committed diagram — 3 findings

STALE NODE (blocker):
  ai/architecture.md:40  box `PaymentGateway`
    No module resolves to it — deleted in commit a1b2c3d (git log --diff-filter=D).
    → remove node + its 2 inbound edges.

MISSING NODE:
  graph has `notifications/` (2 inbound edges: orders→notifications via
  orders/service.ext:88, billing→notifications via billing/worker.ext:31)
  — absent from the diagram. → add node + edges.

LEVEL-MISMATCH:
  Diagram titled "System Context" but contains 6 internal modules
  (Component detail). A Context diagram shows systems + actors only.
  → split: keep Context clean; move internals to a Container diagram.

Regenerated diagram (embedded between markers):

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    orders["orders/"] --> notifications["notifications/"]   %% orders/service.ext:88
    billing["billing/"] --> notifications                    %% billing/worker.ext:31
    ...
  ```

OK: 9 nodes, 16 edges match the graph.
```

Closure verb: **regenerate-and-embed** when the graph is authoritative and the fix is mechanical, **halt-handoff** when the drift reveals a real architectural question (a cycle the picture would expose, a service that should not depend on another).

## False positives / gotchas

- **Renames read as drift until the diagram updates** — a `git mv` shows the old node as "stale" and the new one as "missing". Resolve via `git log --diff-filter=R` before flagging two findings for one rename.
- **External systems have no module `<path>`** — a third-party API or managed DB is a legitimate Context/Container node with no source path. Don't flag it as an unsourced node; label it external.
- **Intentional abstraction in a Context diagram** — collapsing ten internal modules into one "Application" box at Context level is correct, not a missing-node drift. Only flag missing nodes at the diagram's own declared level.
- **The graph is the source of truth, never the picture** — if diagram and code disagree, the diagram is wrong. Never propose changing code to match a diagram.
- **A stale `_dep-graph.json`** produces confident, wrong diagrams. If the graph's pinned commit is behind `HEAD`, that staleness is the finding — re-request architectural-diagnosis, don't render anyway.

## Halt conditions

- Refuse to **render** without a current `ai/optimize/_dep-graph.json`. No graph, no new diagram — request an `architectural-diagnosis` run; do not rebuild the import graph here (that is the boundary).
- **Without the graph, do the half that needs no graph, then stop.** A committed diagram can still be checked for `DIAGRAM-DRIFT (stale node)` by resolving each box's `<path>` against the filesystem — that is an existence check, not a graph rebuild, and it catches the highest-value finding (a box naming a module deleted three months ago). Report those, then mark the remaining axes `UNVERIFIED (no _dep-graph.json — run code-quality's architectural-diagnosis)` and name what they would settle: missing nodes, edge accuracy, level correctness. Halting with nothing when a dead box is visible on the first pass is a worse answer than a partial one that says which half it did.
- Refuse any DRIFT claim without the paired citation: the diagram element **and** the contradicting graph fact (`<path>` / `<path:line>` / deletion commit).
- Do not hand-draw or "improve" a diagram beyond what the graph supports — a box with no module and no external-system label is forbidden.
- Halt on `LEVEL-MISMATCH` rather than auto-mixing altitudes: surface it and let the author choose the split.
- Never edit source to make the picture true — drift is always the diagram's problem.

## Related

- `doc-drift-scan.md` — sibling skill. It catches drift in *text* claims (a doc naming a dead symbol); diagram-sync catches drift in the *picture* (a box naming a dead module). Same failure family, visual surface.
- `system-design.md` (ai-pattern) — supplies the `## High-level architecture` section a generated diagram lands in; a system-design doc's diagram is exactly what this skill keeps honest after the design ships.
- `code-quality` `architectural-diagnosis` (cross-pack) — **the graph source.** It builds `_dep-graph.json` + `_responsibility-map.md`; diagram-sync consumes and renders them. Boundary: it graphs, this draws — neither rebuilds the other's artifact.
- `@doc-writer` — writes the surrounding architecture narrative; diagram-sync owns only the generated-and-verified diagram inside it.
