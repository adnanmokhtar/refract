# module-scaffold

## Premise

Existing siblings are the truth. Mirror their shape — file names, folder layout, import order, DI token style, barrel exports, test naming — exactly. Do not invent a new layout, do not "improve" the conventions, do not skip steps because the sibling looks "old-fashioned". Refuse to scaffold without naming a specific sibling module (path) you mirrored. A scaffolded module that doesn't match its siblings IS the bug.

Refuse to generate `// TODO` stubs in place of real working code; the smoke spec must compile and pass.

End-to-end module generator. Mirrors a sibling module exactly so layout, imports, DI tokens, and test conventions stay consistent.

## When to use

- Creating a new feature module from scratch.
- Onboarding — generate a known-good module structure to study.
- Replacing an old prototype with a properly-layered version.

## Prerequisites

- The project's architecture doc: `ai/patterns/project-structure.md` or equivalent.
- At least one existing sibling module to mirror — never invent layout from scratch.
- Migration tooling installed (Prisma / TypeORM / Alembic / etc.).
- Test runner configured (Jest / Vitest / pytest / Go test).

## Procedure

1. Gather inputs from the user:
   - Module name (kebab-case).
   - One-line purpose.
   - HTTP routes? Webhook receiver? Queue consumer? Scheduled job?
   - Multi-tenant? Soft-delete? Translatable?
2. Read `ai/patterns/project-structure.md` to confirm the declared layout.
3. Read a sibling module — note exactly: file names, folder layout, import order, DI token style (Symbol vs string), barrel exports vs direct imports, test file naming.
4. Consult any framework reference (`.claude/references/<framework>.md`) for idiomatic shape.
5. Generate every file from step "What gets generated" below — each with a real working stub (not a TODO comment).
6. Add the new module to:
   - The app's root module imports.
   - `ai/modules.md` with a one-line row.
   - `ai/status.md` `## Recent Changes` (date + brief).
7. Generate the migration file for the entity (reversible — both `up()` and `down()`).
8. Run the linter + type-checker on generated files; fix any issues before reporting done.

## What gets generated

The exact file tree depends on the project's declared layout (Step 2: read `ai/patterns/project-structure.md`; Step 3: mirror a sibling module). The example below shows ONE plausible layout (Clean / Hexagonal — `core/application/infrastructure/adapters` per module). Adapt to the project's actual layout: a Rails project gets `app/{models,controllers,services}/`; a Django project gets `<app>/{models,views,serializers,urls}.py`; a Go project gets `internal/<feature>/{handler,service,store}.go`; a flat Express app gets `routes/<feature>.js + services/<feature>.js + models/<feature>.js`. Mirror the sibling — don't impose this Clean-Architecture shape on a project that doesn't use it.

```

```

Plus:
- TypeORM/Prisma migration in `database/migrations/` (or `prisma/migrations/`).
- Row in `ai/modules.md`.
- Entry in `ai/status.md` "Recent Changes".

## Generated-file invariants

- Every DTO uses class-validator (or zod / pydantic) — every input field has a decorator.
- Every query in the repo includes the tenant filter if the project is multi-tenant.
- Every entity extends the project's soft-delete base class (whatever name it uses — detected from extraction) if soft-delete is in use.
- DI tokens defined as Symbols in `tokens.ts`, never inline strings.
- Migration is reversible — both `up()` and `down()` populated, no `// TODO`.
- Test files import from the public surface (the module's barrel or controller), not internal paths.

## Output

```
Module scaffold — orders

Files written: 18
Files updated:  3   (app.module.ts, ai/modules.md, ai/status.md)
Migration:      database/migrations/20260424093000-create-orders.ts (reversible)

Lint:           PASS
Type-check:     PASS
Smoke spec:     orders.module.spec.ts PASS

Next steps:
  1. Run migration: bun run migration:run
  2. Implement business logic in use-cases (currently CRUD-only).
  3. Replace the stub success message in locales/en.json + ar.json.
  4. Add domain-specific endpoints beyond CRUD.
```

## False positives / gotchas

- Don't invent a new file layout — mirror the chosen sibling exactly. Inconsistency is the bug, not "improvement".
- Tests that pass with `// TODO: assertion` are worse than no tests — every spec must have a real assertion or the file is rejected.
- Generated mappers must handle null/undefined relations — don't assume eager loading.
- Migration `down()` that just runs `DROP TABLE` is acceptable; `down()` that's empty or `// not implementable` blocks the scaffold.
- Business logic is NOT scaffolded — only CRUD plumbing. Schema design for non-trivial tables: defer to a `schema-architect` agent.

## Halt conditions

- Halt if no sibling module path was named — refuse to scaffold "from the architecture doc alone". Mirror a real, existing module.
- Halt if the generated layout deviates from the named sibling (different folder names, different file names, different DI token style). Inconsistency is the bug.
- Halt if any spec file contains `// TODO: assertion` or no real assertion — empty tests are worse than no tests.
- Halt if the migration `down()` is empty or `// not implementable` — non-reversible migrations are rejected.
- Halt if lint / type-check fails on the generated files — do not declare done with red signals.
