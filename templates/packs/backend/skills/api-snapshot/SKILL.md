description: Snapshot the API's OpenAPI spec and diff it against the last committed snapshot, blocking merge on breaking changes that carry no ADR. Run on any controller or DTO change. Proves the *declared* contract held — `endpoint-test` is the runtime counterpart that proves the running route still matches its DTO.

# api-snapshot

## Premise

Find real contract breaks, not hand-waves. Every flagged change cites the endpoint + the field + the OpenAPI path that changed + the prior shape. "Probably breaking" is not a verdict. A diff that returns clean against a stale baseline is worse than a missing run — re-generate the current spec from a live build, not from cached JSON. Breaking changes without an ADR halt the pipeline.

A "non-breaking" verdict on a renamed field is a misclassification; surface every change explicitly.

## Why

A CI check that fails LOUDLY when you change an endpoint shape. Prevents: accidental field rename, silent type change, removed endpoint, etc.

## Prerequisites

Project emits OpenAPI: NestJS (`@nestjs/swagger`), FastAPI (auto), Spring (`springdoc-openapi`), Laravel (`scramble`), etc.

## Setup

```
api-snapshots/
├── openapi.v1.json              # committed current baseline
├── openapi.v1.snapshot.json     # working baseline (CI re-generates)
├── README.md                    # the lanes the spec cannot carry (see step 0)
└── changes.md                   # optional change log
```

`api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json` is not just this skill's input file — it is the **published** contract, and the only path a consumer can be handed by name. Cite it as a path in every handoff. A consumer told to "read the OpenAPI spec", with no path, reads a controller instead.

## Flow

### 0. First delivery — no baseline exists yet

`oasdiff` needs two documents. On the first delivery of an API — a greenfield service, or the first resource added after this skill is installed — there is exactly one, so the diff is trivially clean and **this gate says nothing about the most consequential delivery the API will ever have**. That case is not "skip the skill"; it is a different job: *establish* the baseline instead of diffing it.

```bash
mkdir -p api-snapshots
curl -sf http://localhost:3000/api-json > api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json   # framework-specific — see step 1
```

Then write `api-snapshots/README.md`. The spec carries paths, methods, and schemas; it does not carry the decisions a consumer has to make on day one, and every one of them is already recorded somewhere in this pack:

| Lane | Value to record | Already decided in |
|---|---|---|
| **Envelope branch** | `project-envelope` or `problem-details` | `ai/patterns/api-contract.md` § Response envelope |
| **Error `code` vocabulary** | the enumerated `code` values these routes emit | `ai/patterns/error-handling.md` § Status mapping |
| **Field-error row** | `{ field, code, message, meta? }` — and that `field` is a **path** (`items[0].quantity`), never a key | `ai/patterns/error-handling.md` § Field-level validation errors |
| **Pagination** | `cursor` or `offset`; the exact `meta` keys; the exact query-param spelling | `ai/patterns/pagination.md` § Rules |
| **Undiffed routes** | streaming / SSE / NDJSON routes + their record shape in prose | § What the snapshot does NOT cover, below |

Recording a lane is copying a decision already made, not making a new one. If a lane has no decision behind it, that is the finding — halt and route it to the pattern that owns it, rather than inventing a value here and letting the snapshot canonise a guess.

The baseline established this way is committed in the same PR as the API it describes, and the run reports `baseline: established (first delivery — no diff performed)`. Never report a clean diff for a run that had nothing to diff.

### 1. Generate current spec
Framework-specific:
- NestJS: `curl http://localhost:3000/api-json > current.json`
- FastAPI: `curl http://localhost:8000/openapi.json > current.json`
- Built artifact: expose `/openapi.json` in test mode, hit it during CI.

### 2. Diff against committed baseline

Use `oasdiff`, pinned (install below):
```bash
oasdiff breaking api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json current.json --fail-on ERR   # exit 1 = a breaking change
oasdiff changelog api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json current.json                # human-readable; never the verdict
```

**`--fail-on ERR` is the gate — NOT-RUN rule.** Without it `oasdiff breaking` prints every breaking change and still **exits 0** (measured 2026-10-14, oasdiff 1.33.0: a removed path, a newly required request field and a removed success status — exit 0 without the flag, 1 with it). So: exit 0 *with* the flag = no ERR-level break; exit 1 = breaking (step 3); any other exit (102 when a spec fails to load, measured), a run without the flag, or an oasdiff that never ran = **`api-snapshot: NOT-RUN (<why>)`** — never reported as clean. `changelog` has no verdict; never read its exit code.

**Install — the Go binary or its Docker image, pinned; never npm** (verified 2026-10-14): the release asset `oasdiff_1.33.0_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` from `github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff/releases/tag/v1.33.0` (the binary sits at the archive root), `go install github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff@v1.33.0`, or the image `tufin/oasdiff:v1.33.0`. npm has no oasdiff: `@tufin/oasdiff` answers 404 (so `npx @tufin/oasdiff` fails), and the unscoped `oasdiff` package is a `0.0.1-security` placeholder. Pin an exact version (`latest` / `stable` tags move), never below 1.18.1 (CVE-2026-53508, external `$ref` resolution, 1.13.2–1.18.0).

### 2b. Runtime half — Schemathesis (when a running build is available)

The diff compares two *declared* specs; Schemathesis checks the running app against the declared one (status codes, `Location`, response schema, negative data, 405 vs 404, use-after-free). Schemathesis 4.31.0 (MIT):
```bash
st run http://localhost:3000/api-json --url http://localhost:3000 --checks all --max-examples 50 --seed 1 --max-time 300 --report junit
```
**Links rule.** The stateful checks (`use_after_free`, `ensure_resource_availability`) walk OpenAPI `links`, and only links on the **response object** (`responses."201".links`) count. Measured 2026-10-14: links declared beside `responses` on the operation → `API Links: 0 covered`; the same links moved into the 201 response → 3 covered, and the run additionally caught a missing `Location` and a use-after-free. Print the `API Links: N covered` line; `0 covered` means the stateful phase is NOT-RUN, not clean. `negative_data_rejection` fails on a documented tolerant reader (a framework that strips unknown keys by design) — read before filing.

### 3. Classify diff

**Breaking (blocks merge)**:
- Endpoint removed
- Parameter removed
- Required request field added
- Required response field removed
- Type changed (string → number)
- Enum value removed
- Auth requirement added

**Non-breaking (warn)**:
- Endpoint added
- Optional parameter added
- Optional response field added
- Deprecated field marked
- Enum value added (consumers tolerant)

### 4. Handle breaking changes

If breaking AND no ADR present at `ai/decisions/` that references this change → FAIL CI.

If ADR exists (declares intentional break + migration path) → warn, ask approval.

### 5. Update baseline after approved break

```bash
cp current.json api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json
# commit together with the breaking-change ADR
```

## CI integration

```yaml
- name: API snapshot diff
  run: |
    pnpm build
    pnpm start &
    until curl -sf http://localhost:3000/health; do sleep 1; done
    curl -sf http://localhost:3000/api-json > /tmp/current.json
    curl -sfL https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff/releases/download/v1.33.0/oasdiff_1.33.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz oasdiff
    ./oasdiff breaking api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json /tmp/current.json --fail-on ERR
    # exit 1 = breaking; without --fail-on ERR this step can never fail (NOT-RUN, step 2)
```

## Output

```
API snapshot diff — feature/add-pagination

Changes detected: 3

✓ Added — GET /products now accepts ?page, ?limit query params (optional)
✓ Added — GET /products response includes `meta.page` (additive)
✗ Breaking — POST /orders: `customer` field renamed to `customerId`

Breaking change detected.

No ADR found referencing this change.
Blocking merge.

To proceed:
  1. If intentional: write ADR in ai/decisions/ describing rename + migration path.
     Update the API to support both `customer` AND `customerId` for a deprecation window.
  2. If unintentional: revert the rename.
```

## Multi-version handling

If the project serves v1 and v2 simultaneously:
- One snapshot per version: `openapi.v1.json`, `openapi.v2.json`.
- Diff only within a version.
- v2 can diverge from v1 freely — no diff between them.

## What the snapshot does NOT cover — say it out loud

A diff gate's danger is not the changes it flags; it is the changes it cannot see, because a green gate reads as "nothing broke". Two blind spots are structural here, and both are verifiable in this pack rather than hypothetical.

**1. Streaming endpoints are exempt by construction.** `api-reviewer` ENF-4 states that a `text/event-stream` / chunked / NDJSON handler "is not held to the response-envelope or `response_model` checks" — correctly, since a stream has no single buffered body to model. The consequence nobody wrote down: with no declared response model, there is nothing for `oasdiff` to compare, so the record shape a streaming route emits can change freely and this gate stays green. A consumer parsing NDJSON rows breaks in production against a passing CI.

What to do about it, in order of honesty:
- **Snapshot the row/event schema separately** — a committed fixture of one representative record (or SSE `event:` payload) diffed alongside the spec. Crude, but it is a real gate rather than an assumed one.
- **Check whether your OpenAPI version can describe the sequential media type** before concluding it cannot. Later revisions of the specification have added keywords aimed exactly at sequential media types; whether the one you emit supports it depends on your generator's output version, which is why the next point exists. Read your generator's emitted `openapi:` field and the corresponding specification revision before writing this off — do not take this file's word for it.
- **At minimum, list your streaming routes in the snapshot's README** as known-undiffed, with the consumer contract stated in prose. An undiffed route that is *documented* as undiffed is a gap; one that silently passes is a false guarantee.

**2. The baseline has no declared spec version.** Nothing in this pack pins one. `oasdiff` classifies changes against the structure it is handed, and a generator upgrade that changes the emitted `openapi:` revision can shift how constructs are expressed — which surfaces as diff noise, or worse, as a real break that classifies as cosmetic. **Record the spec version in the snapshot directory and treat a change to it as its own reviewed event**, not as part of an ordinary API diff. A baseline regenerated under a new spec revision in the same PR as a code change makes both unreviewable.

## Rules

- **The snapshot directory records the emitted spec version** (`openapi:` field) alongside the baselines; a change to it is reviewed on its own, never bundled with an API change.
- **Streaming routes are listed as known-undiffed**, with their record/event contract stated in prose, so a green gate is not read as coverage they never had.
- **A first delivery establishes the baseline; it never reports a clean diff.** No prior document means no diff was performed — say `baseline: established (first delivery — no diff performed)`, and write `api-snapshots/README.md` in the same PR. A green line for a run with one document is a false guarantee, not a pass.
- **Every `oasdiff breaking` carries `--fail-on ERR`**, from a pinned binary or image; a run without the flag, or through npm, is NOT-RUN.
- Snapshot files committed to repo.
- Diff runs on every PR.
- Breaking changes require ADR.
- Non-breaking changes warn, don't block.
- Baseline updated only in the same PR as the approved breaking change.

## Baseline registration

Register the committed spec once in the behavioural-baseline registry (`.claude/baselines/main/manifest.json`, proposal §7) as kind `api-contract`, so run phase P5 captures it before an edit and gate G14 re-runs it when a controller or DTO changes:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/baseline-capture.sh register --id=api-contract-v1 --kind=api-contract \
  --engine=backend/api-snapshot --scope='src/**/*.controller.*,src/**/*.dto.*,src/**/routes/**' \
  --command='bash scripts/api-spec.sh "$REFRACT_BASELINE_OUT/openapi.v1.json"' \
  --harness=scripts/api-spec.sh --artifact=api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json --compare=file --cadence=pr --no-capture
```

- `scripts/api-spec.sh` is step 1 as a script: build, boot, fetch the spec, stop. It is listed in `--harness` because G14 re-runs it in a worktree at the base sha. `--compare=file` diffs the spec JSON-aware, additive changes included. `--compare=exit` with `--command='f=$(mktemp) && bash scripts/api-spec.sh "$f" && oasdiff breaking --fail-on ERR api-snapshots/openapi.v1.json "$f"'` sees only the breaks.
- `--artifact` is the spec this skill already commits, never a copy. `--no-capture` keeps the registration from re-writing it.
- **G13 stays the authority on breaking changes** (step 4, ADR). G14 adds the spec to the P5 capture and to the behaviour diff: quick kind, Stop when in scope, full in CI.
- An intended contract change is declared by an acceptance criterion, `changes_baseline: ["api-contract-v1"]`, next to the ADR a break still needs. Step 5's `cp` with no criterion naming the entry fails `test-integrity.py` (`undeclared-baseline-rewrite`). Re-recording the spec is never how a diff goes away.

Absent that pack the baseline is still worth publishing — it is simply unread inside this repo, and no consumer-impact claim may be made from here. Never assert what a client does; this skill sees the declared contract, never a consumer.

## Halt conditions

- Halt on hand-waves: every diff entry must cite the endpoint path, method, and field. "Some endpoints changed" is not a verdict.
- Halt if the current spec was not generated from a live built artifact — diffing a stale JSON file lies.
- Halt (NOT-RUN) if `oasdiff breaking` ran without `--fail-on ERR`, exited with anything but 0 or 1, or came from npm — its exit 0 proves nothing.
- Halt if a breaking change ships without an ADR in `ai/decisions/` referencing it. No exceptions for "tiny renames".
- Halt if the baseline is updated in a PR that does NOT also contain the approved breaking change — silent baseline bumps mask regressions.
- Halt if a first delivery establishes `openapi.v1.json` with no `api-snapshots/README.md` beside it, or with a lane in it that no pattern in this pack decided. A published baseline whose envelope branch, error-`code` vocabulary, or pagination spelling was guessed here is worse than an unpublished one: consumers will treat it as authoritative.
