# Skill: event-contract-scan

## Premise

An event outlives the code that wrote it. It sits in a topic, a dead-letter queue, an event store or a replay corpus while producers and consumers deploy on their own schedules, so every change to its shape is a change to a contract nobody re-signs. A required field added to the producer's schema rejects every event already stored; a field removed breaks every consumer still reading it; an enum symbol added crashes a reader that throws on the unknown; `amount` that quietly moves from minor to major units passes every compatibility tool and charges a hundred times over. Event-sourced systems add their own: an append with no expected version lets two deciders both win, a custom event table with no `UNIQUE(stream, version)` stores both, a projection that increments and saves its checkpoint separately double-counts on every redelivery, an `apply()` that sends mail resends it on every replay, and a UI that redirects to a projection right after a command shows the old state. This skill finds those places and proves each with its oracle. Read-only: it never edits code and never touches a registry, broker or store that is not a scratch container.

**A compatibility tool is an oracle only when it parsed both sides.** Measured on 2026-10-14 (the tool lane below): json-schema-diff exits **1** both for "breaking" and for a file it could not parse; `asyncapi diff -t breaking` exits **0** on a required payload field added (payload changes are *unclassified*); oasdiff reads a head with no paths as "every path removed"; buf exits **1** on "no .proto files" and **100** on a misaligned `--against` root. So a run prints one of `PASS`, `BREAKING`, `NOT-RUN (exit n: <first line>)` or `blocked (lane not installed)` — a tool that parsed nothing is **NOT-RUN, never PASS**, and with no base to compare against §1 and §4 print NOT-RUN.

It owns `/ds-audit`'s Contracts (§1–§5) and Event sourcing (§6–§10) ledger rows. `@event-sourcing-architect` (this pack) judges its rows.

**Every finding cites the schema, event type or append `<file:line>` + the base it was compared against (`--contract-base=<dir>` or the merge-base) + the reader or decider that breaks + the [`broker-semantics.md`](../../../../snippets/broker-semantics.md) row its verdict rests on (SZ1–SZ13, EV1–EV3), read at the installed version + the tool exit or the oracle that showed it, or the test that would settle it + the fix in the project's own primitive** (its schema module, its event envelope, its store's expected-version API, its projection base). A grep hit is a candidate. "Contracts look compatible" is never printed; the output is the class-coverage block (§ Output). Verification follows [`refute-before-report.md`](../../../../snippets/refute-before-report.md) with [`precedents/distributed.md`](../../../../snippets/precedents/distributed.md) § 28–30. The oracles are [`proof-oracles.md`](../../../../snippets/proof-oracles.md) § Distributed, V323–V327.

## The rule

A candidate is a finding when all four hold — the protocol's gates as `precedents/distributed.md` § Reading the seven gates applies them.

1. **Part A holds: this is an event contract, an event-store write or a projection** that another process, a replay or a later release reads. A schema another service consumes, an envelope on a broker topic, an append to a stream, a read model fed from events. An HTTP request DTO, an LLM tool-parameter schema, a websocket push to a browser, a config schema or a type used inside one process fails here.
2. **Part B holds at the installed version.** The format's rule or the store's default is a named row: a reader field with no default (SZ2), `BACKWARD` checked against the latest version only (SZ3), Jackson's `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` on a plain `new ObjectMapper()` (SZ6), KurrentDB's Node `appendToStream` defaulting to `streamState: ANY` (EV1), Marten's plain `Append` with no guard (EV3). A verdict with no row is invalid.
3. **Nothing already controls it**, across files and repositories. A registry with `_TRANSITIVE` compatibility and auto-registration off, a CI compatibility gate, a Pact provider verification with `can-i-deploy`, a tolerant reader configured on the shared mapper, an upcaster for the old version, a library store that owns uniqueness (precedent 30), a projection write and checkpoint in one transaction. **Read the consumers in this repo and name the ones outside it**: a change with no reader anywhere is not a break.
4. **The oracle fired, or the fact is two-ended.** The format tool exited breaking on base → head (tier T, V323), a fixture or replay corpus failed (V324), two deciders both appended (V325), a redelivered event changed the read model (V326), or a static fact cites both ends — the removed field's `file:line` and the reader that dereferences it. Without one the row is `[report-flagged]` / Unconfirmed with the settling test written out.

## Boundaries

One class, one owner. A neighbour that sees the same `file:line` lists it as corroboration.
- **HTTP API drift** (an OpenAPI spec against the running server, request and response shapes) → backend `http-contract-scan` § 10 (its `oasdiff` lane), when the backend pack is installed. §1 here runs `oasdiff` only on **webhook** payloads this service sends. **Job payload drift inside one service across a deploy** (a job enqueued by the old release, run by the new) → backend `job-lifecycle-scan` § 3; this skill owns events that cross a process or service boundary. **Money as a float in a payload** → backend `wire-format-scan` § 5; §4 cites it when the unit or encoding of an existing event changes.
- **A parsed message cast to a type with no runtime check** (`JSON.parse(raw) as OrderEvent`, `cast(Order, json.loads(body))`) → code-quality `type-safety-scan` § 1, when that pack is installed: its measured BAD lines are exactly these, so §2 prints `→ code-quality type-safety-scan §1 (k)` and does not grade them. §2 owns the contract half — a topic whose schema is in S1–S3 consumed without its schema or registry deserializer, and what a malformed event does to the consumer. Without the code-quality pack §2 reports the casts, tagged `boundary cast (owner pack not installed)`.
- **NestJS microservice transports the global pipe never reaches** (`@EventPattern` / `@MessagePattern` without `inheritAppConfig` or `@UsePipes`) → backend `validation-boundary-scan` § 8; **unknown-key policy on HTTP DTOs** (`forbidNonWhitelisted`, a strict request schema) → its § 6. A strict reader on an **outbound** DTO is not §3 (precedent 28).
- **What happens to an event that keeps failing** (poison, DLQ, requeue loop) → `messaging-scan` (this pack) § 3; §2 and §3 here hand over a crash-looping malformed or unknown event with the contract mechanism as evidence. **A consumer with no reserve** → `messaging-scan` § 2; §8 here owns a **projection's** write and checkpoint.
- **A gap-blind catch-up cursor over an event table** (`WHERE id > $last`) → `dual-write-scan` (this pack) § 6. **Events ordered by a wall-clock timestamp across streams** (`ORDER BY created_at` in a projector) → `coordination-scan` (this pack) § 9; 9d prints its count. **Workflow history versioning** (a Temporal change with executions open) and a process manager's compensation → `workflow-scan` (this pack) § 2 and § 4–§ 6; the event schemas a process manager reads are §1–§5 here.
- **An async projection daemon on every replica** (Marten `DaemonMode.Solo` behind an HPA) → performance `request-path-scan` § 20 (V40), when that pack is installed; without it reported here tagged `once-per-fleet (owner pack not installed)`. **A read after a write on a lagging database replica** → database `connection-config-scan` § 8; §10 owns the projection lag.
- **A decide-append on a balance, stock or credit stream** → security `logic-race-scan` § 5, when the security pack is installed, with the missing expected version as evidence; without it reported here tagged `money invariant (owner pack not installed)`.
- **Writing consumer-driven contract tests** (Pact message pacts, Spring Cloud Contract) → testing `contract-test`. §1 reads whether they run and gate a deploy.

## Adapt to the codebase — the contract lanes

Read every schema, registry, contract and event-store library **with its version** (F1). Facts are rows of `broker-semantics.md` § Event contracts and event stores (tagged and dated there); a row tagged `[K?]` makes its verdict Unconfirmed until the settling test runs. The event-store lanes beyond Node (Marten, KurrentDB .NET and Python, Axon, the Python `eventsourcing` library) and the typed-deserializer lanes are in [`stacks.md`](stacks.md), loaded only when F1 printed that stack.

| Lane | What decides compatibility | Tool (§1) | Rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Protobuf** (`*.proto`, `buf.yaml`) | field numbers and types; FILE is buf's default category, WIRE_JSON the recommended minimum for events | `buf breaking <module> --against <base>/<module>` | SZ1 |
| **Avro** (`*.avsc`, a Confluent registry) | a reader field with no default the writer lacks is an error; a writer enum symbol unknown to the reader needs the reader's `default`; renames only through aliases; `BACKWARD` checks the latest version only | the `avsc` resolver both ways (block below), or the registry's `test-compatibility` | SZ2, SZ3 |
| **JSON Schema** (`$schema` = json-schema.org) | open vs closed content model (`additionalProperties`); `required`; types | `json-schema-diff` both directions | SZ5 |
| **AsyncAPI 2/3** | channel addresses and operations (classified); message payloads (**unclassified** — compare them as JSON Schema) | `asyncapi diff -t breaking`, plus the unclassified count | SZ4 |
| **OpenAPI `webhooks:`** this service sends | a webhook body is judged as a request: removed or retyped properties break receivers | `oasdiff breaking --fail-on WARN`, read for direction | SZ7 |
| **TS-only event types** (no schema file) | the old consumer compiled against the new type | read the diff of the type (5c/§4); a `tsc` run on a scratch copy is the oracle | — |
| **Consumer-driven** — Pact message pacts, Spring Cloud Contract | the provider's `MessageProviderPact.verify()` in CI; `pact-broker can-i-deploy` before a deploy (pact-js 17.1.4, research notes B § 5.0, 2026-10-14) | the CI line in S6 is the gate | — |
| **Event stores** — KurrentDB Node (`@kurrent/kurrentdb-client`), Emmett, a custom table through an ORM | Node `appendToStream` defaults to `ANY`; a custom table owns no uniqueness until it declares it | 6a, 7a–7c | EV1; others in [`stacks.md`](stacks.md) (EV2, EV3) |

### The tool lane — exit codes (measured 2026-10-14, build)

| Tool | Clean | Breaking | NOT-RUN shapes | Traps the block guards |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| buf 1.73.0 | 0 | 100, with `file:line:col:` lines | 1: "had no .proto files", a missing path, a missing branch, a shallow clone without the base branch | `--against '.git#branch=main'` from a module that is not the repo root, without `subdir=`, exits 100 on an **additive** change ("Previously present file … was deleted"): roots misaligned. The block compares directory to directory and turns that line into NOT-RUN when the file exists in head |
| json-schema-diff 1.0.0 | 0 | 1 + "Breaking changes found" | 1 + `VError` (a parse error, a missing file, an unresolved `$ref`, a 2019-09 or 2020-12 `$schema`: `no schema with key or ref "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`, measured 2026-10-14) — the **same exit code** as breaking; the block prints a 2019-09/2020-12 document NOT-RUN before running it | base → head is backward only: a head emptied to `{}` passes it and fails head → base, so both directions run. `enum`, `const`, `pattern`, `format`, `if`/`then`/`else` are **not compared** (the package's `KEYWORDS.md`): an added enum symbol prints "No differences found" — the block prints `PARTIAL` |
| @asyncapi/cli 6.2.1 | 0 | 1 + `DiffBreakingChangeError` | 1 + `ValidationError` | a required payload field added is `unclassified`, exit 0. An `info.version` edit alone (2.2.0 → 2.3.0) exits **1** as `"path": "/info/version", "type": "breaking"` (measured 2026-10-14): a correctly bumped document reads as broken — the block prints `VERSION-BUMP` when `/info/version` is the only breaking path. The CLI writes `~/.asyncapi-analytics` and reports each run to a remote metrics endpoint unless `CI=true` or `ASYNCAPI_METRICS_CONFIG_PATH` names a file with analytics off — the block sets both |
| oasdiff 1.33.0 | 0 | 1 at the `--fail-on` level | 102 (a file that did not load) | a head reduced to `openapi: 3.0.3` exits 1 as "api-path-removed": check S4 parsed. A webhook property removed is WARN (`--fail-on ERR` exits 0); a property newly *required* in what we send is ERR though receivers are unaffected. Never install it from npm (a placeholder package, SZ7) |
| avsc 5.7.9 resolver | 0 | 3 (the block's one-liner) | 2 (a schema that did not parse) | `createResolver` takes reader ← writer: run both directions; an added enum symbol fails forward only |

## Read the code — per event, before any §

Start from F2's contract inventory and the consumers, not from vocabulary. For each event type, answer these; the § each answer feeds is in brackets.
- **Who reads this event, where, and on which release?** The consumers in this repo (5b, the subscribe lines), the ones outside it (an AsyncAPI `receive` operation, a Pact consumer, a README), and the stored events a replay will read [§1, §5].
- **Which direction must the change be compatible in?** Consumers upgrade first (backward), producers first (forward), or independently (full); is the registry mode transitive for a topic whose retention is long or infinite [§1]?
- **Where is the payload checked against its contract** — a registry deserializer, a generated class, a zod or pydantic parse on the path — and what does the consumer do with a malformed one: park it, or throw and redeliver it forever [§2]?
- **What does the reader do with what it does not know** — an extra field, a new enum symbol, a new event type? Is the strict schema on the inbound or the outbound side [§3]?
- **Did the meaning change while the shape stayed** — a unit, a scale, a time zone, what `null` means, what a status covers [§4]?
- **Is the name in one place** — a shared constant, a generated client, the AsyncAPI document — and does the envelope carry a version the readers branch on, with an upcaster for each old one [§5]?
- **For a store:** what did the decider read before it appended, and does the append carry that version; what keeps two writers from both appending version n+1 [§6, §7]?
- **For a projection:** is its write idempotent per event, and does the checkpoint commit in the same transaction; does `apply` only mutate state; does a snapshot carry the schema version it was written with [§8, §9]?
- **For a UI flow:** after the command returns, what does the next screen read, and does it wait for the position the command returned [§10]?

## Pre-flight greps

Run as **one** script from the repo root (shell state does not survive between tool calls; bash 3.2 has no `mapfile`). Grep **N** feeds detector **§N**; F lines are the gates and the inventory. Every `rg` names its path — `.` or `"${ROOTS[@]}"`: given no path, `rg` reads stdin under an agent's shell and reports a silent zero. Include globs come **first** in every command, exclusions last (for a path several globs match, the last one wins). Any `rg` exit 2 is a failed grep, never zero hits. File-level greps use `--files-without-match`, never `rg -L` (that is `--follow`). Migrations are searched **on purpose** for §7: the schema is the evidence.

### The contract lane — §1 and §4 against a base

Appended to the block above, in the same script (it reads `$T/s1`–`$T/s4` and `$T/n5`). The base is `--contract-base=<dir>` — a tree that mirrors repo-relative paths (`<dir>/schemas/orders.avsc` is the base of `schemas/orders.avsc`), for a repo with no base branch or a fixture — passed as `CONTRACT_BASE`, else the merge-base with `BASE_BRANCH` (default `origin/main`), whose copies are read with `git show` into `$T`. No base → `BASE NOT-RUN`, and §1 and §4 print `NOT-RUN (no base)`. Tools resolve from `PATH` or `./node_modules/.bin`; a missing one prints `blocked`, and its schema's changed lines still print in 4 for the read.

Reading the output:
- **F1 is the version gate** and the lane selector: the schema tooling, the registry client, Pact, the store. A stack beyond Node loads [`stacks.md`](stacks.md). **F2 is the subject list.** S1–S4 empty and no TS event type in 5c means §1 is `N/A (no schema files)` and the CONTRACT GATE is `N/A`; S6 empty with schema files present is a gate gap the audit prints, not a finding. S5 shows the registry mode: `BACKWARD` on a topic with long retention is §1's transitive row (SZ3).
- **`1t` lines are verdicts of a tool, never of this run.** `BREAKING` is a candidate whose part A (a reader exists) still needs the read; `PASS` with a `PARTIAL` line means the enum and pattern half is unread; `NOT-RUN` and `blocked` are listed in the coverage block as such.
- **2a is the input; 2b the strong list.** A 2a line wrapped as `X.parse(JSON.parse(…))` is excluded; a cast `as T` goes to code-quality (§ Boundaries). 3b prints every strict reader; part A decides inbound vs outbound (precedent 28). 5a–5c print lists for the read, never verdicts: a name another vendor owns (a third-party webhook topic) refutes at part A.
- **ES evidence gates §6–§9.** Zero files and zero tables → `N/A (no event store, aggregate or event table)`. 9d's count is printed for `coordination-scan` § 9, never graded here.

Three blind spots are structural, so work around them instead of trusting a quiet grep:
- **The consumer lives in another repository.** A schema with no reader here (5b "produced, never consumed") is the normal shape of a platform event: name the consuming services from the AsyncAPI `receive` operations, the registry's subjects or the README, and keep the §1 row Unconfirmed until one is read (precedent 5's shape).
- **The schema is generated.** A schema emitted from code (zod-to-json-schema, a protobuf from annotations) has no committed base; the diff of the source type is the evidence, and the generator run on base and head is the oracle.
- **Names built at run time** (`${domain}.${event}`) never reach 5a or 5b: read the producer wrapper once and list its names.

The git base gives the same verdicts; the shallow clone prints `BASE NOT-RUN`. Unparseable heads print **NOT-RUN** (json-schema-diff `VError`, asyncapi `ValidationError`) — never PASS. Greps: the near-twin `order.placed` / `orders.placed` and the produced-never-consumed / consumed-never-produced pair (5a, 5b), `OrderPlacedEvent` declared in two modules (5c), `json.loads(body)` in a Celery task (2b), `apply()` that mails (9a), a snapshot with no version (9b), a Prisma event model with no `@@unique` (the one with it quiet), an ORM entity, a SQL table cleared by a later unique index (7b), command → 303 and mutate → navigate (10a, 10b).

Changed: F1 adds the package's zod; 2a 4 parses (the fourth a browser CSP report body: HTTP, part A); 3c 1; **5c 1 → 5** — the report payload now also in the contracts package, plus four chat, support, team-chat and system message types declared in the contracts package (zod-inferred) and again as hand-written interfaces in the web app: HTTP payloads, so part A routes them to backend and frontend, never a broker row. The rest below is the earlier partial copy (not a git checkout) | 1.8 s, 0 rg errors. S1–S4 **0** → §1 `N/A (no schema files)`, CONTRACT GATE N/A, `BASE NOT-RUN`. 2a **3 → 0**: an outbound carrier-API response and a token payload (not messages, part A), and a Redis pub/sub session event parsed inside a `try` with a hand-written guard that returns `null` on a wrong shape (gate 4). 3a 0, 3b 0, 3c 2 zod `.passthrough()`. 5a **1 → refuted** (a third-party platform's webhook topic named in two connectors — the vendor owns the name); 5b 1 (a websocket event to browsers, part A); 5c 1 (an HTTP report payload declared in the API and the web app → backend). Queue names are shared constants — the GOOD shape — so 5a sees none. ES evidence 0 → §6–§9 N/A; §10 N/A. First-draft noise removed before shipping: 56 `additionalProperties: false` in LLM tool-parameter schemas (3b now reads that key only in schema documents and consumer files), `address`/`channel`/`subject` keys that are data fields (5a), a name split on `:` (`session:ended` read as `ended`), browser DOM event types (5c now counts services), and a SQL column-projection helper that opened §10 |

## The 3,000-hit path

1. **Start from F2, not from the greps.** A repo with schema files is judged by the tool lane first; one tool run per module or document replaces a thousand grep lines. A repo with none prints §1 `N/A` and moves to the consumers.
2. **Intersect** 2a–3b with the consumer files (`CONS`, 2c) and the process types that run them: a parse in a script, a seed or a test fixture is dismissed with one read. Name the directory in the coverage block.
3. **Group by root cause**: one shared deserializer, one base consumer, one envelope type, one projection base class is **one** finding with N sites. Schema findings group by the event, not by the field.
4. **Rank**: events another service or a stored stream depends on first (orders, payments, stock, identity); then events with a replay path; then internal notifications.
5. **Read the top 30 groups**; sample 10 sites per group, and the rest inherit the verdict with the group's id.
6. **Run the bulk oracle once**: V324's replay-old-events corpus over every consumer of the top event; V325 over the top aggregate.
7. **Ledger the rest** as `Live, unreviewed (k groups / n hits — <continuing command>)`. Never mark it `checked`.

## Scans for

Severity assumes a production path. One replica does not make a contract or store row latent (precedent 32).

| § | Classes | Default severity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | EC-1 breaking schema change (diff lane) | high; BLOCKER when a removed or retyped field is read by a consumer that deploys apart from the producer, or a deleted schema still has subscribers; medium for `BACKWARD` (latest only) on a long-retention topic |
| 2 | EC-2 inbound event not checked against its contract | medium; high when a malformed event crash-loops a partition or persists garbage another service reads |
| 3 | EC-3 intolerant reader | high when the producer deploys independently; medium otherwise; not a row for the service's own internal union or an outbound schema (precedent 28) |
| 4 | EC-4 semantic change with the same type (read-only) | high; never above Unconfirmed without V324's replay corpus |
| 5 | EC-5 name drift; producer-only types; no version or upcaster | medium for a near-twin live on both sides (split brain); low for a duplicated literal; high for a stored event shape changed with no upcaster |
| 6 | ES-1 append without expected version after a read-decide | high; money, stock and credit invariants → security (§ Boundaries) |
| 7 | ES-2 custom event table without UNIQUE(stream, version) | high |
| 8 | ES-3 projection not idempotent; checkpoint outside the projection's transaction | high when someone acts on the figure; medium for a display-only read model |
| 9 | ES-5 side effects in `apply`; snapshot without version | high for an external effect on replay; medium for a snapshot |
| 10 | CN-2 eventual consistency assumed in a UI flow | medium |

### 1. Breaking schema change (EC-1)

```
BAD:   message OrderPlaced { string order_id = 1; string coupon = 2; }   // field 2 was int64 amount_minor: tag reused (buf 100)
       "required": ["orderId", "amountMinor", "currency"]                  // a required field added: every stored event fails the new reader
       {"type":"enum","name":"Status","symbols":["PLACED","PAID","REFUNDED"]}   // old readers have no enum default (SZ2)
       compatibility: BACKWARD on a topic with infinite retention          // latest-only check (SZ3)
       a webhook body losing a property receivers read (oasdiff WARN) · a schema file deleted while consumers subscribe
GOOD:  a new field number and `reserved 2;` · a new optional field with a default · an enum default · BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE / FULL_TRANSITIVE
       a new versioned event type for a breaking shape, both published until every reader moved · the compatibility tool in CI
```
**Read the code:** Which `1t` line, at which exit, against which base? Who reads the event (in this repo, in another, in a replay), and which direction must hold — is the registry mode transitive (S5)? Did the tool parse both sides (a `NOT-RUN` is never a pass)? For AsyncAPI, compare the payloads (`unclassified`) as JSON Schema or read them; for JSON Schema with `PARTIAL`, read the enum and pattern diff by hand. For a TS-only type, would the old consumer still compile against the new one? Is the change fronted by a new event type or an upcaster (§5)? **Finding when** a reader that deploys apart from the writer cannot read an event it will receive or has stored. **Proof (V323):** the format tool exits breaking on base → head before the fix and 0 after (tier T); a fix that adds `--no-error` or sets the registry to `NONE` fails the variant. Writing a provider verification is testing `contract-test`.

### 2. Inbound event not checked against its contract (EC-2)

```
BAD:   const evt = JSON.parse(message.value.toString()); await apply(evt.amount)      // no schema on a topic whose schema is in S3
       evt = json.loads(body); Order.objects.create(**evt)                            // a Celery task writing whatever arrived
       a consumer of an Avro topic reading raw bytes with JSON.parse instead of the registry deserializer
GOOD:  const evt = OrderPlaced.parse(JSON.parse(raw)) · Order.model_validate_json(body) · the registry's AvroDeserializer
       — and a malformed event parked (DLQ, a failed set) instead of thrown back for redelivery
```
**Read the code:** Is this a broker message from another process (part A — an HTTP body, a WebView message, a cache entry is not)? Is the value cast (`as T`) — then code-quality `type-safety-scan` § 1 owns it — or used raw? Does the topic have a schema (S1–S3) that this consumer bypasses? Is there a guard further down (a `typeof` check, a try that returns `null`)? What does a malformed event do: park, skip with a log, or throw and redeliver (→ `messaging-scan` § 3)? **Finding when** a malformed or wrong-version event reaches an effect or a crash loop. **Proof (V324):** feed the malformed fixture to the real handler: parked, not a crash loop, no write.

### 3. Intolerant reader (EC-3)

```
BAD:   switch (evt.type) { …; default: assertNever(evt.type) }   // in a consumer of another team's events
       z.object({...}).strict() / extra="forbid" / UnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow on an INBOUND event
       private final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();     // FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES on (SZ6)
       an Avro reader enum with no "default" (3d) · additionalProperties: false on a consumer-side schema
GOOD:  default: log and ack (or park) the unknown type · zod's default strip or .passthrough() · the Spring Boot mapper
       mapper.configure(FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false) · READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_USING_DEFAULT_VALUE · an Avro enum default
```
**Read the code:** Is the strict schema applied to what this service **receives** from another producer, or to what it sends or owns (precedent 28)? Is the `assertNever` over the service's own compile-time union, or over a type read from the network? Is the mapper the framework's configured bean or a hand-made one? Does a tolerance marker (3c) configure the same mapper? **Finding when** a producer adding a field, an enum symbol or an event type makes this consumer throw. **Proof (V324):** the extra-field and unknown-type fixtures are acked or parked by policy without a throw.

### 4. Semantic change with the same type (EC-4)

```
BAD:   - JSON.stringify({ id, amount: total })   + JSON.stringify({ id, amount: total / 100 })   // minor → major units, same field, same type
       durationS now carrying milliseconds · a nullable field whose null now means "unknown" instead of "none"
GOOD:  a new field (amountMinor) or a new event version, the old one kept until readers moved · units in the field name
```
**Read the code:** Line 4 prints changed lines with a scale factor, a rounding call or a unit-suffixed field, in schemas and in files that name a topic: did the meaning of a field another reader uses change? Money as a float in the payload is backend `wire-format-scan` § 5's — cite it. Every compatibility tool passes this class (the seeded `amount` change passed buf, json-schema-diff and avsc). **Finding when** an existing reader computes a wrong value from an event it reads correctly. **Proof (V324, replay corpus):** deserialise captured events of each version through the current consumer: same meaning, 0 failures.

### 5. Name drift, producer-only types, no version or upcaster (EC-5)

```
BAD:   topic: 'orders.placed' in three files, 'order.placed' in one        // a rename splits producers from consumers
       interface OrderPlacedEvent { … } re-declared in billing with a different field
       a stored event class changed in the diff, no schemaVersion in the envelope, no upcaster registered
       an envelope with no producer-set event id, so every consumer reserves on a broker id that changes on redelivery
GOOD:  one constant, a generated client or the AsyncAPI document · one shared schema package · schemaVersion + an upcaster per old version
       a producer-set event id in the envelope (CloudEvents `id`, `eventId`) minted once per fact
```
**Read the code:** For 5a, is each literal the same channel, and is one side a typo or a stale rename? Is the name owned by another vendor (part A)? For 5b, where is the other side — another repo, a CDC topic, a test only? For 5c, do the declarations' fields differ, and is the type an event at all? For 5d, has the envelope already changed shape (the §1 diff, a branch on `'field' in evt`), and is there an upcaster for each stored version? Does the envelope carry an event id the producer sets once — the contract half of `messaging-scan` § 2's unstable reserve id (rows ID1–ID9)? **Finding when** a producer and a consumer that must meet do not, or a stored event can no longer be read. **Proof (V324):** the replay-old-events corpus through the current consumer; for a rename, publish on the producer's name and assert the consumer receives it.

### 6. Append without expected version after a read-decide (ES-1)

```
BAD:   const s = await load(id); if (s.stock < qty) throw …; await client.appendToStream(`order-${id}`, evts)   // default ANY (EV1)
       await client.appendToStream(stream, evts, { streamState: ANY })   after a decision on loaded state
GOOD:  await client.appendToStream(stream, evts, { streamState: revisionLoaded })   // WrongExpectedVersionError → reload, re-decide
       Marten FetchForWriting<T>(id) (EV3; stacks.md) · the store's optimistic API with the version read
```
**Read the code:** Did the code read the stream and branch on its state before this append? Then which revision did it read, and is it passed? Is the stream append-only facts with no invariant — audit, telemetry (precedent 29)? Is a lock or a single writer per stream the control instead (name it)? A money, stock or credit invariant goes to security (§ Boundaries). **Finding when** two deciders working from the same version can both append. **Proof (V325):** two deciders released by a barrier → one append succeeds, the other gets `WrongExpectedVersion`.

### 7. Custom event table without UNIQUE(stream, version) (ES-2)

```
BAD:   CREATE TABLE order_events (id bigserial primary key, stream_id uuid not null, version int not null, data jsonb)
       model OrderEvent { id Int @id; streamId String; version Int }     // no @@unique([streamId, version])
GOOD:  UNIQUE (stream_id, version) or PRIMARY KEY (stream_id, version) · @@unique([streamId, version]) · @Unique({ properties: ['streamId', 'version'] })
```
**Read the code:** Does a later migration add the unique index (7b)? Is the table written by a library store that owns the constraint (Marten, the Axon JPA store, the Python `eventsourcing` library — precedent 30)? Is it an event *log* (webhook deliveries, an outbox) rather than a stream store? Is the version computed from a read (`max(version) + 1`)? **Finding when** two concurrent appends of version n+1 both commit. **Proof (V325, SQL layer):** two transactions insert `(stream, n+1)` → the second fails with a unique violation after the fix.

### 8. Projection not idempotent; checkpoint outside its transaction (ES-3)

```
BAD:   await db.query('UPDATE stats SET orders = orders + 1'); await checkpoints.save('stats', e.position)   // two commits
       the checkpoint saved before the projection write · INSERT INTO order_view … with no conflict guard
GOOD:  the read-model write and the checkpoint in one transaction · an upsert keyed by event id or position
       (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, WHERE last_position < :pos) · a rebuild-and-swap projection
```
**Read the code:** Are the projection write and the checkpoint in one transaction on one store? Is the write idempotent per event (keyed by event id, position-guarded, SET not INCREMENT)? Does a redelivery or a restart from the last checkpoint re-apply the event? Is it a full rebuild-and-swap (cleared for the rebuild path)? A projection fed by a broker with no reserve at all is `messaging-scan` § 2's. **Finding when** a redelivery or a crash between the two writes changes the read model. **Proof (V326):** inject a throw between the write and the checkpoint, restart → the read model unchanged; redeliver one event → unchanged.

### 9. Side effects in `apply`; snapshot without version (ES-5)

```
BAD:   apply(e: OrderShipped) { this.status = 'shipped'; this.mailer.sendShipped(this.id) }   // replay mails every customer again
       a snapshot row { id, state } with no schema version, loaded and returned without applying the tail
GOOD:  apply mutates state only; a subscriber with its own reserve sends the mail · a snapshot carrying schemaVersion and streamVersion,
       discarded on a mismatch, then the events after streamVersion applied
```
**Read the code:** Does the method run during rehydration (`loadFromHistory`, an `evolve` fold, an `@EventSourcingHandler`) or only on the command path? Is the I/O a pure in-memory call? Does the snapshot loader compare the version it was written with against the aggregate's current shape, and replay the tail? A daemon running on every replica is performance § 20's (9c); timestamp ordering is `coordination-scan` § 9's (9d). **Finding when** a replay or a rebuild repeats an external effect, or a snapshot of an old shape is used as current state. **Proof (V326):** replay the full stream through the aggregate with the side-effect port mocked to count → 0 sends; load a v1 snapshot into the v2 aggregate → discarded or upcast.

### 10. Eventual consistency assumed in a UI flow (CN-2)

```
BAD:   await this.commandBus.execute(new PlaceOrderCommand(dto)); return res.redirect(303, '/orders')   // the list reads an async projection
       await createOrder.mutateAsync(v); navigate('/orders')   // the loader reads the lagging read model
GOOD:  return the new id and position; the next read waits for it (or reads the write side) · an optimistic UI entry reconciled later
```
**Read the code:** What does the redirect target read — the write model, or a read model fed asynchronously? Does the command return a position or version, and does the read wait on it (10c)? Is the lag observable (a list missing the new row, a stale balance)? A replica lag is database's. **Finding when** the next screen reads a projection that has not caught up and shows the old state as fact. **Proof (V327):** write → redirect → read with the projection paused: the new value appears, or the read waits on the returned position.

```

`[report-with-fix]`: the tool or the oracle failed on the unfixed code, and the fix is local to the project's schema, envelope, store call or projection. `[report-flagged]`: one link is unproven (a tool `blocked` or `NOT-RUN`, a reader in another repo, no replay corpus); the row names it and the settling test. The coverage block lists **all ten** §s on every run: `checked (k → m)`, `N/A (<reason>)`, `NOT-RUN (no base)`, `blocked (<tool>)`, `→ <owner> (k)` or `Live, unreviewed (k groups / n hits)`. A missing line is printed by `/ds-audit` as `not run`.

## False positives / precedents

The verifier reads [`precedents/distributed.md`](../../../../snippets/precedents/distributed.md) and [`refute-before-report.md`](../../../../snippets/refute-before-report.md) § 4. The ones this skill meets most:
- **§ 28** additive, optional changes are compatible (an Avro field with a default, a new protobuf field number, a JSON field for tolerant readers); a strict reader on an **outbound** DTO is not an intolerant reader. **§ 29** `streamState: ANY` is correct for append-only facts with no invariant. **§ 30** library event stores own the uniqueness constraint.
- **§ 13** `WHERE id > $last` over one serial writer (the cursor itself is `dual-write-scan` § 6's). **§ 31** timestamps are fine for display and audit. **§ 32** one replica does not make a store row latent. **§ 33** a mocked store or bus proves nothing about concurrency. **§ 34** a comment saying "backward compatible", "consumers ignore unknown fields" or "the registry checks it" is a pointer: read the registry mode, the mapper and the consumer.

Shapes this skill must not report: a `.strict()` request DTO or an LLM tool schema; `assertNever` over the service's own union; a topic a third-party vendor names; a schema change no reader receives; a tool `PASS` reported as proof while its `PARTIAL` line is unread; `ORDER BY created_at, id` within one stream.

## When to run

- On any diff that touches a schema file, an event type, an envelope, a producer mapping, an event-store append, an event table migration or a projection — `/ds-audit`'s "a schema file, an event type, an event-store append, a projection" signal. Pass `--contract-base=<dir>` when the repo has no base branch (a fixture, an export, a vendored copy).
- On every whole-repo `/ds-audit`, reporting all ten §s; before changing a registry compatibility mode, renaming a topic, adding a field to a long-retention event, or introducing snapshots.
- After `/add-event-handler`: its Phase 6 runs V324 from the same oracle file.

## Halt conditions

- **Do not report a high row as confirmed until a separate verifier has refuted it.** That verifier is not the run that found it, gets part A, part B, the base, the tool's exit and first line, the `broker-semantics.md` row and the version lines — never this run's reasoning — and passes the row through [`refute-before-report.md`](../../../../snippets/refute-before-report.md) with `precedents/distributed.md`. Under `/ds-audit` that is its verification phase; standalone, apply the protocol as a second pass and tag the rows `self-verified`. List the rest as Unconfirmed, Hardening, Pre-existing or Refuted; never drop them.
- **Never print PASS for a tool that did not parse both sides.** A non-zero exit without the tool's breaking marker, a `VError` or `ValidationError`, a load failure, a misaligned buf root or a missing base is `NOT-RUN` with the first line; with no base at all §1 and §4 are `NOT-RUN (no base)`.
- **Never run the AsyncAPI CLI with its metrics on** (`CI=true` and `ASYNCAPI_METRICS_CONFIG_PATH`, as in the block), never install `oasdiff` from npm, and never call a schema registry, broker or event store outside a scratch container — `test-compatibility` against a shared registry registers nothing, but its credentials are the user's to give.
- **Halt on any finding missing its anchors:** the schema or append `file:line`, the base, the reader or decider, the row, the fix in the project's own primitive.
- **No fix may make the check pass instead of the contract:** `--no-error`, a registry set to `NONE`, `.passthrough()` on a schema whose strictness was a decision, or a version gate removed. Changing a registry compatibility mode is a STOP for `/ds-fix`.
- **Do not grade a class another pack owns** (§ Boundaries); route it with a count. **Do not print "contracts look compatible"** without the coverage block; a § whose grep did not run is `blocked`, never `checked`.

## Related

- `/ds-audit` dispatches this skill and folds its coverage block into the Contracts and Event sourcing ledger rows and the CONTRACT GATE; `/ds-fix` closes findings with the failing-first tool run or oracle, the fix in the project's schema, envelope, store call or projection, a re-run of this detector and the sibling sweep.
- `messaging-scan` (poison, consumer reserve), `dual-write-scan` (the outbox, gap-blind cursors), `coordination-scan` (timestamp ordering) and `workflow-scan` (history versioning) are the neighbours named in § Boundaries; `@event-sourcing-architect` judges these rows.
- code-quality `type-safety-scan` § 1, backend `http-contract-scan` § 10, `job-lifecycle-scan` § 3, `wire-format-scan` § 5 and `validation-boundary-scan` § 6, § 8, testing `contract-test`, security `logic-race-scan` § 5, performance `request-path-scan` § 20 and database `connection-config-scan` § 8, when those packs are installed.
